Unity-Procedural
================

At the moment this is mostly experimentation with splines and mesh generation.

I haven't done any work on this in a while, but I may revisit it since people seem to be finding it!

For now it has simple implementations of bezier and catmull-rom splines including extrusion and mesh generation with texturing.
